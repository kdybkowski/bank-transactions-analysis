# Bank Transactions Analysis - Design Document

## Project Overview
This project visualizes and analyzes bank transaction data to provide insights on customer behavior, account balance distribution, transaction trends, and more. The app uses Streamlit for the front-end, providing an interactive user experience.

## App Structure:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data is loaded from a CSV file.
   - Missing values are removed.
   - New calculated columns are created: Age, Balance Categories, Transaction Types.
   - Date-related features are extracted: Year, Month, Day.

2. **User Interface**:
   - **Streamlit Sidebar**: Filters for selecting transaction data based on year, month, and transaction type.
   - **Main Panel**: Interactive visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and heatmaps, to analyze different aspects of transactions.

3. **Data Visualizations**:
   - **Customer Age Distribution**: Histogram.
   - **Balance Category Distribution**: Bar chart.
   - **Monthly Transaction Trends**: Line chart.
   - **Transaction Type Distribution**: Pie chart with legend.
   - **Monthly Transaction Amounts**: Heatmap.

## Design Decisions:
- **Color Scheme**: The color palette for visualizations (e.g., using 'viridis' for bar charts) is chosen to be visually appealing and clear.
- **Interaction**: Users can filter by transaction month and type for more detailed insights.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, Streamlit)
- **Streamlit** for deploying the app.
- **Data Source**: Bank transaction data (CSV).
